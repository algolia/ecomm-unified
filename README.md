</div>

---

Build your Ecommerce Search & Discovery experience in no time using this framework-agnostic prebuilt UI that offers out-of-the-box a robust as-you-type InstantSearch experience, while retaining the customizability of [Algolia InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/).

Designed to accelerate your Algolia integration, this mobile-optimised UI has been created to best fit any website UI via its full page overlay and offers a direct access to the following Algolia key features:

- Typo proof as-you-type InstantSearch experience
- Query Suggestions
- Advanced Analytics with A/B testing
- Dynamic Re-ranking
- Personalization
- Merchandising capabilities, including banners via Rules

On the frontend side, once compiled, the total package weighs under 300kb and runs on any existing website, regardless of the framework used (see [Browser support](#browser-support)). Its impact on Core Vitals is almost transparent.
